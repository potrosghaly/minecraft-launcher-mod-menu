## About the Project

**Universal Minecraft Launcher** is a free, open-source Minecraft launcher built for advanced client-side customization, modular extensions, and deep runtime configuration.

The project focuses on giving users full control over their client environment without permanently modifying the base game files. Everything is modular, reversible, and transparent.

This launcher is intended for users who want to explore the limits of client customization, experiment with behavior, visuals, and performance, and build their own extended setups.

---

## Design Philosophy

The launcher is built around several key principles:

- The client environment belongs to the user  
- Customization should be flexible and optional  
- Extensions must be modular and isolated  
- Experimentation should be safe and reversible  
- Transparency is mandatory  

Universal Minecraft Launcher does not enforce a predefined experience. Instead, it provides a foundation that adapts to different needs and workflows.

---

## Features

### Modular Extension System

The launcher includes a built-in system for loading independent client-side modules at runtime.

- Dynamic enable / disable without reinstalling
- No permanent modification of game files
- Clean separation between core and extensions
- Ideal for testing and experimentation

### Runtime Interaction Layer

Universal Minecraft Launcher provides a controlled runtime layer that allows advanced interaction with the client process during startup and execution.

This makes it possible to:
- Attach custom logic dynamically
- Adjust client behavior at runtime
- Explore internal systems in a controlled environment

All actions remain local and fully visible to the user.

---

### Profiles & Environments

Create and manage multiple isolated profiles:

- Separate Minecraft versions
- Independent runtime settings
- Profile-specific extensions
- Custom JVM and startup parameters

Switching between environments takes seconds.

---

### Performance & Visual Control

The launcher includes tools for fine-grained tuning:

- Memory and CPU allocation
- Rendering behavior adjustments
- Visual overlays and interface tweaks
- Optimized startup configuration

Designed to scale from minimal systems to high-performance setups.

---

### Clean and Minimal Interface

The UI is focused on clarity and speed:

- Minimalistic layout
- Logical navigation
- Real-time status indicators
- Integrated logs and diagnostics

No unnecessary elements. Everything serves a purpose.

## Use Cases

Universal Minecraft Launcher adapts to many workflows:

- Experimental client builds
- Development and testing of client-side extensions
- Custom visual or performance-focused setups
- Multiple isolated environments
- Educational exploration of client behavior

The launcher provides tools — usage is defined by the user.
